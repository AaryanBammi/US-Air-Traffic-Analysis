# US-Air-Traffic-Analysis
This project presents an analysis of international passenger and U.S. air traffic to provide actionable insights for airlines’ strategic decision-making. Utilizing data from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s “U.S. Airline Traffic by Airport” and “International Passenger Report” datasets, we examined passenger volumes, freight loads, and market dynamics over the past decade.

**Purpose and Objectives**

The primary objective was to analyze U.S. airport data to uncover trends in passenger and freight traffic, understand seasonal variations, and evaluate market share among carriers. Specifically, we aimed to:
	1.	Compare and integrate data from two key datasets to identify unique and overlapping airports.
	2.	Calculate annual passenger volumes and assess year-over-year changes.
	3.	Analyze passenger and cargo destinations to highlight popular routes.
	4.	Investigate seasonal variations in passenger volumes at the top five busiest U.S. airports.
	5.	Examine freight load trends and the impact of significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Methodology**

We consolidated data from five key states—California, Alaska, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Georgia—due to their high passenger and freight volumes. Rigorous data cleaning ensured reliability, including handling null values and standardizing formats. Advanced SQL queries and data visualization techniques were employed to extract meaningful patterns and trends.

**Key Findings**
	1.	Growth Trends and Declines: Passenger volumes generally increased over the years but experienced significant declines during major events such as the 9/11 attacks, the 2008 financial crisis, and notably a 73.8% reduction in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
	2.	Seasonal Variations: Passenger volumes peak during the second and third quarters, aligning with vacation and holiday seasons. Top routes, particularly between JFK and international destinations like London Heathrow (LHR) and Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), show increased traffic during these periods.
	3.	Market Share Analysis: American Airlines (AA) and United Airlines (UA) hold the largest market shares by passenger volume, indicating strong positions on key international routes. The presence of carriers like British Airways (BA) and Lufthansa (LH) underscores the competitive nature of these markets.
	4.	Freight Load Trends: Freight transport showed a steady increase from 2012 to 2022, with a notable surge during the pandemic years, reflecting heightened demand due to global supply chain disruptions and increased e-commerce activity.
	5.	Major Airport Hubs: Airports like Los Angeles International (LAX), Chicago O’Hare (ORD), and San Francisco International (SFO) serve as significant hubs for international travel, with the busiest routes being predominantly transpacific and transatlantic.

**Recommendations**
	•	Enhance Operational Flexibility: Adopt dynamic scheduling and resource allocation to adjust to seasonal demand fluctuations and unexpected global events.
	•	Optimize High-Demand Routes: Increase flight frequencies and capacity on popular routes during peak seasons to enhance profitability. Reevaluate underutilized routes for potential adjustments or targeted marketing efforts.
	•	Diversify Services: Expand freight operations and develop partnerships with logistics and e-commerce companies to create additional revenue streams and buffer against passenger travel disruptions.
	•	Implement Customer-Centric Strategies: Offer flexible booking policies, comprehensive travel insurance, and tailored marketing to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
	•	Leverage Data Analytics: Continuously analyze passenger and freight data to anticipate market trends, adjust to competitive dynamics, and enhance strategic planning.

This analysis underscores the importance of adaptability and strategic foresight in the ever-evolving air travel industry. By implementing these recommendations, airlines can better navigate uncertainties, optimize operations, and capitalize on growth opportunities in a fluctuating market.
